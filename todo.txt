() Ch 1 - Background Review
	() Review more of existing methods, Bayesian and Frequentist, and where LT model fits
	       () If have data that HMM is amenable, what methods can you use
	       () Blind source separation
	       () Identifying temporal clustering

(*) Ch 3 - adding section / augmenting discussion of kernels
	(*) add general discussion of conditions of kernels:
		List constraints on kernels that are needed in order to be appropriate for LT model
		1. should return valued [0..1] or naturally normalizable to do so
		2. should be translation invariant (shift invariant; linear kernel doesn't do this)
		3. similarity between value between self should be 1
		4. differentiable everywhere when using HMC
	
	(*) Identify some classes of sim. functions with different properties
() Experimental contrast of similarity functions
	() Comparing kernels with different tail thickness (Cauchy
        vs. Exp. vs. Gaussian)
	
	[currently using Gaussian and Laplace (Exponential)
		- Laplace in Ch 4, Gauss in Ch 6 ]
	
	- Additional kernels to add to experiment domains:
		() Ch 4: [Laplace], Gaussian, Cauchy
		() Ch 5: Gaussian, Laplace, Cauchy
		() Ch 6: [Gaussian], Cauchy kernel (messy algebra involved)
			Laplace not possible in Ch 6 (not differentiable everywhere)

() Model sensitivity analysis - augment reporting of experiment results in Chs 4-6
	() Assess effect of parameters:
		() prior of Lambda
		() prior of concentration parameters

() Ch 4 - Cocktail Party
	(*) add figures
	()  sticky HMM

() Ch 5 - Categorical latent space
	() Run REDD experiment report results
	() compare with LT, noLT, Sticky

() Ch 6 - Continuous Latent Space
	() Different parameters for HMC
		to get clustering of locations -- possibly not exploring enough
	(*) Music data
		* Define our evaluation metric
		* compare with LT, noLT, sticky (not factorial b/c not prior known latent channel)
		* CLAY: get more data from the same grammar (chord1) - test set

() Ch 7 - Write
	() future work
		- Full beam sampling method
		- variation inference
		- Applications
			- further work on blind source, disaggregation; music
			- Biopaper context application
