() Ch 1 - Background Review
	() Review more of existing methods, Bayesian and Frequentist, and where LT model fits
	- If have data that HMM is amenable, what methods can you use
	- blind source separation
	- identifying temporal clustering

() Ch 3 - adding section / augmenting discussion of kernels
	() add general discussion of conditions of kernels:
		List constraints on kernels that are needed in order to be appropriate for LT model
		1. should return valued [0..1] or naturally normalizable to do so
		2. should be translation invariant (shift invariant; linear kernel doesn't do this)
		3. similarity between value between self should be 1
		*4. differentiable everywhere when using HMC
	[kernel can return a negative value]
	[has to give you a positive value if you integrate]
	
	() Identify some classes of kernels with different properties
		and experimentally contrast them
		- Comparing kernels with different tail thickness
			Cauchy vs. Gaussian
		- Look at common kernels
			- linear (inner-product), polynomial  <-- not normalized
			- if normalize by product of norms, then is like correlation
		- Inner product of likelihoods (symmetrized KL divergence?)
	
	[currently using Gaussian and Laplace (Exponential)
		- Laplace in Ch 4, Gauss in Ch 6 ]
	
	- Additional kernels to add to experiment domains:
		- if identify any other kernel classes, demonstrate representatives...
		
		- Ch 4: [Laplace], Gaussian, Cauchy
		- Ch 5: Gaussian, Laplace, Cauchy
		- Ch 6: [Gaussian], Cauchy kernel (messy algebra involved)
			Laplace not possible in Ch 6 (not differentiable everywhere)

>> Model sensitivity analysis - augment reporting of experiment results in Chs 4-6
	() Model structure and parameters
	() Synthetic data, data properties
	- So far, data has been more influential than the prior	
	- general parameters to assess:
		prior of Lambda
		prior of concentration parameters

() Ch 4 - Cocktail Party
	- construct data from HMM that has means and variances
	- add sticky HMM to curve
	- states linearly transformed into means (like cocktail party)
	- add cocktail party figures
	- add sparse, non-symmetric transition matrix discussion (with binary states)

() Ch 5 - Categorical latent space
	- Run REDD experiment report results
	- compare with LT, noLT, sticky (not factorial b/c not prior known latent channel)

() Ch 6 - Continuous Latent Space
	>> block synthetic data
	- when syn data diverges from blockdata, difference between LT/noLT goes away
	- Different parameters for HMC
		- to get clustering of locations -- possibly not exploring enough
	>> music data
		- Define our evaluation metric
		- compare with LT, noLT, sticky (not factorial b/c not prior known latent channel)
		- CLAY: get more data from the same grammar (chord1) - test set
	- add sparse, non-symmetric transition matrix discussion (with binary states)

() Ch 7 - Write
	() future work
		- Full beam sampling method
		- variation inference
		- Applications
			- further work on blind source, disaggregation; music
			- Biopaper context application
